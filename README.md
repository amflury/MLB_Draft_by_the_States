# Project-2
This project uses webscraping and sqlite to load data into a flask server. The data is then used with javascript to make various charts. 

Please clone the Repo to you desktop and follow the steps below to launch the server and operate the site.
1. Open a Git Bash or Terminal from the Repo.
2. Activate the PythonData environment.
3. type python app.py
4. type http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your web browser.
5. Scroll around and look at the various charts.
6. On the Map you can click on states to see how many draft picks come from that state. You can also use the dropdown menus to select either a year or a team, and the dataset and map will reflect this selection.
7. You can look at the raw data by adding /all-data to the url. a JSON should appear showing the baseball data.
8. You can also go to /states to find a JSON of the states and abbreviations, as we need to convert from abbreviations to the full state name.
9. You can hover over the cicular packing section to see how much money each team paid in bonuses over the time period.
